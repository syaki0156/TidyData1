I have to write what I think about this course and it project.
Generally it's obviously very intersing and useful. It is also very hard and mainly this project. No doubt it is very educational, but god, give us a break; ease things a little bit! Give us more time after the course to finish it. All in all it realy is OK and of course the instrucor is really somthing rare. (in a good way, of course.) I'm not sure I finished it well, but from the bottom of my heart: Thank you!
